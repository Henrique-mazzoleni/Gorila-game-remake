# Gorilla 1991 game remake
The here recreated game is an old DOS game where two gorillas battle for dominance in a city landscape. Each gorilla is equiped with exploding bananas and take turn throughing them ate each other.

This small project had the goal of developing a game using only HTML, CSS and JS to render a playable client-side web-game.

### Adaptations

I've taken the liberty to enhance a few things about the old game.

- Firstly the gravity input was taken out for simplicity sake.
- The graphics have also changed to give it a more modern look.
- The input was changed from a simple text input to a mouse capture with a mouse click release.

### Future additions

There are some aspects that I still want to go through and enhance in the game.
- Add a computer player so it can be played as a one player game.
- Add Sounds and music!
- adapt the game to be playable on mobile
- add a online playable option
